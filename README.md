Welcome to **Tic-Tac-Toe: The Unbeatable AI**, a meticulously crafted Python implementation of the classic game powered by artificial intelligence. Face off against an AI that leverages the Min-Max algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to deliver flawless gameplay—can you outsmart it, or will you settle for a draw?

This project isn’t just a game; it’s a demonstration of algorithmic elegance, strategic thinking, and clean code design. Whether you’re a developer looking to study AI, a student exploring game theory, or just here for a challenge, this repository has something for you.

## 🌟 Features

- **Unbeatable AI**: Powered by the Min-Max algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, the AI ensures optimal moves every time—draws are the best you’ll get against it!
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Play as X against the AI (O) with a simple command-line interface. Enter moves as `row col` (e.g., `0 0`).
- **Move Visualization**: See all possible next boards before your turn, giving you a strategic edge (or at least the illusion of one!).
- **Robust Design**: Modular, well-documented code with functions for game state management, win detection, and AI decision-making.
- **Educational Value**: Perfect for learning adversarial search algorithms, game tree optimization, and Python programming best practices.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TicTakToe-Min-Max-Algorithm.git
   cd TicTakToe-Min-Max-Algorithm
   ```

2. **Run the Game**:
   ```bash
   python game.py
   ```

3. **Gameplay**:
   - You’re Player X (first move).
   - Enter moves as `row col` (0-2, space-separated, e.g., `1 1` for center).
   - The AI (Player O) responds instantly with an optimal move.
   - Watch the board update and see if you can force a draw!

4. **Tips**:
   - Start at the center (`1 1`) for your best shot at a draw.
   - Use the visualized options to plan your strategy.

## 🧠 The AI Under the Hood

The AI’s brilliance lies in the **Min-Max algorithm with alpha-beta pruning**:

- **Min-Max**: Explores the entire game tree, maximizing X’s score while minimizing O’s, ensuring optimal play.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Cuts off branches that won’t affect the outcome, reducing complexity from O(9!) to O(√9!)—efficiency meets perfection.
- **Key Functions**:
  - `minimax(board, alpha, beta, maximizingPlayer)`: Core recursive logic for move evaluation.
  - `alpha_beta_pruning(board)`: Wrapper to kick off the AI’s decision-making.
  - Supporting cast: `player()`, `actions()`, `result()`, `terminal()`, `utility()`.

The result? An AI that never loses—either it wins or forces a draw, embodying the solved nature of Tic-Tac-Toe.

## 💡 Why This Project Stands Out

- **Algorithmic Mastery**: Implements a classic AI technique with optimization, showcasing problem-solving skills.
- **Clean Code**: Modular design with clear separation of concerns—game logic, AI, and UI are neatly divided.
- **Learning Tool**: Detailed logic and visualizations make it an excellent resource for studying game AI.
- **Challenge Accepted**: Try to beat the AI—it’s a fun test of strategy against perfection.
